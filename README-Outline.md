# Section 1: Project overview
Brief description of the BBO capstone
What the goal is
Why this challenge is relevant in real ML
How this supports your future career

# Section 2: Inputs & outputs
What the functions receive
Query format (0.xxxxxx-0.xxxxxx etc.)
Dimensions of F1–F8
What the outputs represent (scalar fitness/performance)
Constraints (one query per function per week, must start with 0, 6 decimals)

# Section 3: Challenge objectives
What you are trying to achieve: maximisation
Limitations: unknown surfaces, small number of queries, delayed feedback
“Black-box" nature

# Section 4: Technical approach
Describe your methods across three rounds:
Initial exploration
Week 2 adaptive strategy
Week 3 exploitation-heavy refinement
Then answer:
What ML methods you used (Gaussian Processes, EI, UCB)
Could SVMs/regression help?
How you balanced exploration vs exploitation
What makes your approach thoughtful/unique
